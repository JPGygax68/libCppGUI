- Specification on how to extend existing widgets, e.g. how to add position marks to a scrollbar

- Test tab focus cycling with nested containers

- Make it possible to customize the root widget (with/without background color, others ?)

- Focus: simplify by redefining take_focus() to return a boolean that reports whether or not focus was accepted or not:
    - eliminate focussable() - THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE!
    - override to pass focus on to child (if original focus recipient is a container that cannot give optical/other feedback to user)
    - verify / reimplement cycle_focus() action
    
- Button and Glyph_button have too much in common to exist (on_pushed()!) for completely separate implementations
  - Also, the background and border is provided by Boxed<>
  -> the base class should probably be called something like Clickable_base (rather than "Button_base")
  
- Double-click text selection in Textbox is not working at this time

- Mouse capture when selecting text in Textbox is not working at this time

- Cannot click-select buttons in Listbox (tab selection works)
