- Specification on how to extend existing widgets, e.g. how to add position marks to a scrollbar

- Test tab focus cycling with nested containers

- Make it possible to customize the root widget (with/without background color, others ?)

- Focus: simplify by redefining take_focus() to return a boolean that reports whether or not focus was accepted or not:
    - eliminate focussable() - THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE!
    - override to pass focus on to child (if original focus recipient is a container that cannot give optical/other feedback to user)
    - verify / reimplement cycle_focus() action
